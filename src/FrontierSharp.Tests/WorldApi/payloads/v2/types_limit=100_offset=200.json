Scans reveal city-sized mass graves just below the planet’s surface, but any remains within those groupings are so severely deteriorated as to be impossible to identify.\r\n\r\nApproaching Planet H-SN21 I triggered a planetary automatic warning. This signal was heavily distorted and had clearly been consumed in no small measure by hostile memetic interference. The phrases that could be deciphered and reassembled are collected below.\r\n\r\n“This place is forsaken.”\r\n“The sin we commit here is too grave to be forgiven.”\r\n“We sought a way to end wars.”\r\n“In our folly we pulled too hard on the strings of creation.”\r\n“There is a thing here that suffers no intelligent creature to pass, that consumes cognition and devours thinking-meat.”\r\n“We have tried to destroy it, but there exists no panacea for this sickness.”\r\n“It is a wretched thing, an angel of peace turned sword against us.”\r\n“Learn from this error, spoken now only by our corpses: there can be no peace through fear of death.”\r\n“Death will find you all the same, just as it found us.”\r\n“Leave this place, and our dusty bones. Do not come here.”\r\n“This place is forsaken.”",

Enriched with Iron and Nickel, these asteroids provide durable materials for spaceship hulls and engine components. They harbor light metals like Aluminum, used for constructing lightweight yet robust spaceship parts, optimizing fuel efficiency and maneuverability. Precious elements such as Platinum and Gold can be extracted for high-end electronics and power systems. Common Asteroids also house a wealth of Silicates, which can be processed into Silicon, a fundamental element in crafting sophisticated electronic and computer systems. Finally, the presence of Carbonaceous compounds allows for the production of complex organic materials and carbon fiber structures granting enhanced durability to spacecrafts without significantly increasing their weight.",
